# Codecademy - Learn the Basics of Machine Learning
 Applying Python for building machine learning models.
### 1. Linear Regression
 Given a set of points, find a line that fits the data best.

### 2. Multiple Linear Regression
 Uses two or more independent variables to predict the value of the dependent variable.

### 3. Yelp Regression Project
 Practice regression skills on a real-world dataset provided by Yelp.

### 4. Classification vs. Regression
 Learn about the two types of Supervised Learning algorithms, for predicting different kinds of output.

### 5. Classification: K-Nearest Neighbors
 Implement and test this algorithm on several datasets.

### 6. Logistics Regression
 Find the probability of data samples belonging to a specific class with one of the most popular classification algorithms.

### 7. Decision Trees
 Build and use decision trees and random forests - two powerful supervised machine learning models.

### 8. Clustering: K-Means
 Finds structure in unlabeled data by identifying similar groups.

### 9. Perceptron
 Use it to divide linearly-separable data.

### 10. Artificial Intelligence Decision Making: Minimax
 Create a game playing AI that can play Tic Tac Toe and Connect Four.
